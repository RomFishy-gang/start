You know ISOs? Yeah, those images you use to flash a linux distro, or windows to a flash drive.
They are pretty complicated to keep up-to-date. Every time there is a new version of a linux distro, I'd need to go to the distro's website and redownload it.
It would be nice if there would be a program that can automatically update ISOs, but I don't know of such a program.
I used to just put ISOs in one folder, but I changed that recently. Now I put them in special folders (linux, windows, arch-based, debian-based, etc..)
If you know of a program that can auto-update ISOs let me know by [emailing me](mailto:hi@sheepdev.xyz) :)
