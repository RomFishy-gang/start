You know iso's? Yeah, those images you use to flash a linux distro, or windows to a flash drive.
They are pretty complicated to keep up-to-date. Every time there is a new version of a linux distro, I'd need to go to the distro's website and redownload it.
It would be nice if there would be a program that can automatically update isos, but I don't know of such a program.
I used to just put isos in one folder, but I changed that recently. Now I put them in special folders (linux, windows, arch-based, debian-based, etc..)
If you know  of a program that can auto-update isos let me know in the comments :)
