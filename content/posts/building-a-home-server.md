First, I wan't to apologize for my inactivity in writing blog posts, I have been busy with stuff.

Anyways, what I have got around to doing is building my own home server!
I plan to self-host PhotoPrism, FreshRSS, and a few other apps. The specs of the server are as follows:

# üè† Home Server Build

* CPU: `Intel Core 13-10100F`
* Motherboard: `ASRock H510M-HVS R2.0`
* RAM: `8GB DDR4`
* Power Supply: `Fortron Hexa+ PRO 400W`
* Storage:
  * `Patriot P210 128GB` - System Drive	
  * `2x WD Red Plus 4TB` - Storage Drives
* System: `Debian` (not installed yet due to me missing a graphics card)

The drives will be set up as RAID 2

Ill update you later when I get to installing the OS and all the apps & docker containers :)
