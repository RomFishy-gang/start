Here are some of the projects **I am currently working on**, most of them are smaller projects.

[Solis](https://github.com/solis-theme) is one of my more recent projects. It is a minimal color scheme inspired by the warm colors of the sun.

Some of its elements are taken from colorschemes such as [Rose Pine](https://rosepinetheme.com), [Nord](https://nordtheme.com) and [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin).

## winthemers

Well, this is not really a project, but it is a community I created.

[Winthemers](https://discord.gg/8BdXn5ZTSw) is a discord community dedicated to customizing windows.

We have many resources on theming and changing every aspect of Windows, we are basically the `r/unixporn` of windows
