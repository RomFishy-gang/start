Here are some of the projects I have worked on, most of them are smaller projects.

## Nord Userstyles (archived)

In the past, I have worked on nord-themed userstyles:

[nordtube](https://github.com/sheeepdev/nordtube) - nord themed youtube \
[nordhub](https://github.com/sheeepdev/nordhub) - nord themed github

They are currently archived because I switched away from nord.

## Lunar

[Lunar](https://github.com/lunar-theme) is one of my more recent projects. It is a black and blue color scheme inspired by the endless beauty of space.

Some of its elements are taken from colorschemes such as [Rose Pine](https://rosepinetheme.com), [Nord](https://nordtheme.com) and [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin).

As you can probably see, I'm using it on this website.

[I have also made userstyles](https://lunar-theme.github.io/ports), similar to how I made the nord userstyles.

## winthemers

Well, this is not really a project, but it is a community I created.

[Winthemers](https://discord.gg/8BdXn5ZTSw) is a discord community dedicated to customizing windows.

We have many resources on theming and changing every aspect of Windows, we are basically the `r/unixporn` of windows

## Distroeraser

This one is straight out of the oven!

[DistroEraser](https://github.com/sheeepdev/distroeraser) is a script that erases your entire drive to get it ready for a distrohop / new OS!

It is intended for distrohoppers, *such as me* who like to start fresh.
