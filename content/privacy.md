# Privacy Policy

In this Policy, when I refer to “this website”, “my website” or simply “it”, I’m referring to the website `sheepdev.xyz`.

This website uses cookies/javascript only to detect Dark/Light mode. No other analytics bullshit. My website is free, and always will be free from any tracking.

# Analytics

I use Cloudflare as my DNS provider. They provide analytics with DNS so I sometimes check up on traffic there, just so I know theres no one DDOSing my website.

I don't use ANYTHING that could be tracable to you. The analytics only provide me with countries where the traffic is coming from.

Since I use netlify (which doesn't provide logs) I cannot anyhow access any info.

# Hosting

As I said, I use netlify for website hosting. Their privacy policy can be found [here](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/).
