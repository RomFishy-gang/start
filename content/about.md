## 🐏 About me
Hey there! I'm sheep, a web developer from Zagreb, Croatia. I enjoy ricing my system and love technology and programming, I know some C#, python and shell scripting but im always trying to learn new things :)

## 🌐 About this website
This is my website, its my own space on the internet where I post anything that comes to mind, from blog posts to projects and updates.
I consider this website to be a part of the [Small Web](https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/), a collection of personal websites that are away from "big tech" compaines

## 📊 Privacy and Analytics
Currently, I don't use any analyitcs on this website. I do, once in a while, check up on the traffic via Cloudflare.
I do plan to subscribe to an analytics service in the future, like [umami](https://umami.is/) or [Plausible](https://plausible.io/).

## 💻 Technology
This website was built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) SSG and the [hello-friend-ng](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) theme.

The website is currently hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/pages) but I also plan to switch to my own VPS soon™️.

## 👏 Credits
I want to give credits to some people that I have took inspiration from for this website:
